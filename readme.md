# TypeScript Concepts: Enums and Type Inference

This document covers two essential TypeScript features‚Äî**Enums** and **Type Inference**‚Äîexplaining what they are, why they're useful, and providing clear examples to help developers understand their role in building scalable applications.

---

## üß† What is the use of Enums in TypeScript?

Enums (short for "enumerations") are a way to give more friendly names to sets of numeric or string values. They improve code readability and reduce the chance of bugs caused by using incorrect string literals or magic numbers.

### Why Enums?

- Avoid hard-coded values like `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`, etc.
- Easy to iterate, compare, and use in switch-case structures.
- Helps with autocompletion and refactoring in IDEs.

### Numeric Enum Example

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up,      // 0
  Down,    // 1
  Left,    // 2
  Right    // 3
}

const move = Direction.Up;
console.log(move); // 0
````

### String Enum Example

```ts
enum Role {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
  Guest = "GUEST"
}

const userRole = Role.User;
console.log(userRole); // "USER"
```

## üí° What is Type Inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

Type inference is TypeScript‚Äôs ability to automatically deduce the type of a variable or expression when it's not explicitly annotated.

### Why It‚Äôs Helpful:

* **Less Boilerplate:** You don‚Äôt always need to manually annotate types.
* **Safe & Smart Defaults:** TypeScript understands operations and constraints based on initial values.
* **Developer Experience:** Better IntelliSense, autocompletion, and static analysis.

### Example

```ts
let greeting = "Hello, world!"; // inferred as string
// greeting = 42; // ‚ùå Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'

function add(a: number, b = 5) {
  return a + b; // return type inferred as number
}
```

With inference, TypeScript strikes a balance between **type safety** and **developer productivity**.

## ‚ú® Conclusion

Both Enums and Type Inference play a critical role in creating clean, maintainable, and type-safe code in TypeScript:

* Use **Enums** to eliminate magic strings/numbers.
* Leverage **Type Inference** to write less but safer code.
